*** Shell Scripts

These are some cool scripts which basically is a menu of options, which are handy for window manager users.

Its is fast and also snappy.

*Most of the scripts are based on Wayland (as it is the Future of Linux)*
Although you can adjust it for x11 too.

Old-scripts directory is x11 based.
